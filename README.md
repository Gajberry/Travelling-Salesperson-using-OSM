# Travelling Salesperson using OpenStreetMap

This notebook uses OpenStreetMap to retrieve data and then applies a greedy algorithm and an exhaustive algorithm to the Travelling Salesperson problem. Additional locations can be added, though be aware that the run time increases exponentially for the exhaustive search.

This notebook was created as part of my teaching assistantship at UBC for MATH 441 Mathematical Modeling: Discrete Optimization Problems.
